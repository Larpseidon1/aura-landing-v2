        <h2 className="text-[1.5em] md:text-[1.3em] mt-8 mb-4 text-[#34495e]">2. Personal data and the Blockchain</h2>
        <p className="mb-4">
          Blockchain technology, also known as distributed ledger technology (DLT), is at the core of our business. Blockchains are decentralised and made up of digitally recorded data in a chain of packages called "blocks". The manner in which these blocks are linked is chronological, meaning that the data is very difficult to alter once recorded. Since the ledger may be distributed all over the world (across several "nodes" which usually replicate the ledger) this means there is no single person making decisions or otherwise administering the system (such as an operator of a cloud computing system), and that there is no centralised place where it is located either.
        </p>
        
        <p className="mb-4">
          Accordingly, by design, a blockchain's data cannot be changed or deleted and is said to be "immutable". This may affect your ability to exercise your rights such as your right to erasure ("right to be forgotten"), or your rights to object or restrict processing of your personal data. Data on the blockchain cannot be erased and cannot be changed. Although smart contracts may be used to revoke certain access rights, and some content may be made invisible to others, it is not deleted.
        </p>
        
        <p className="mb-4">
          In certain circumstances, in order to comply with our contractual obligations to you (such as delivery of tokens or provision of other services) it will be necessary to collect certain personal data, such as your wallet address, onto the blockchain; this is done through a smart contract and requires you to execute such transactions using your wallet's private key.
        </p>
        
        <p className="mb-4">
          <strong className="text-[#2c3e50]">The ultimate decisions to (a) transact on the blockchain using your wallet address, as well as (b) share the public key relating to your wallet address with anyone (including us) rests with you. IF YOU WANT TO ENSURE YOUR PRIVACY RIGHTS ARE NOT AFFECTED IN ANY WAY, YOU SHOULD NOT TRANSACT ON BLOCKCHAINS AS CERTAIN RIGHTS MAY NOT BE FULLY AVAILABLE OR EXERCISABLE BY YOU OR US DUE TO THE TECHNOLOGICAL INFRASTRUCTURE OF THE BLOCKCHAIN. IN PARTICULAR THE BLOCKCHAIN IS AVAILABLE TO THE PUBLIC AND ANY PERSONAL DATA SHARED ON THE BLOCKCHAIN WILL BECOME PUBLICLY AVAILABLE.</strong>
        </p>
        
        <p className="mb-4">
          Specifically, information regarding your digital wallet addresses (including transactions performed by said digital wallet addresses), public cryptographic key relating to digital wallet addresses on distributed ledger networks and/or similar information which you utilise to access the Website will be linked to your user account. By accessing our services, you provide your consent to our services reading and/or accessing information from such digital wallet addresses in order to verify ownership of any digital assets or tokens associated with such address (whether fungible or non-fungible). Users will have the ability to "add" their digital wallet address to access our services, as well as the ability to "remove" such stored wallets. All data obtained by us in connection with your digital wallet addresses shall be treated as personal data and dealt with in accordance with the provisions of this Policy.
