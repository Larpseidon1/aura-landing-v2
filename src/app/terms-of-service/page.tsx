        <p className="mb-4">
          Aura is a non-custodial visual user interface (the "<strong className="text-[#2c3e50]">App</strong>") which allows users to interact with a variety of integrated third party protocols, tools and APIs, in order to perform functions such as trade perpetual contracts on third party protocols (in particular, Hyperliquid Perps), create/participate in vaults to algorithmically engage in self-selected on-chain strategies, transact across a variety of different blockchain network (each, the "<strong className="text-[#2c3e50]">relevant Blockchain Network</strong>"), and access/join/create social trading groups in an easy-to-use manner.
        </p>
        
        <p className="mb-4">
          The App allows users to interact with smart contracts deployed by third party protocols, for example Hyperliquid (each, a "<strong className="text-[#2c3e50]">Smart Contract</strong>") in order to perform on-chain functions directly in a peer-to-peer manner in respect of the selected digital assets. Users will be able to both (a) trade as well as (b) act as market makers for these transactions by staking/pooling their digital assets into decentralised liquidity pools which collectively function as issuers of perpetual contracts or other trading instruments (<strong className="text-[#2c3e50]">Liquidity Pools</strong>) to provide the necessary liquidity for transactions by other users. The underlying digital assets may be a variety of fungible cryptocurrencies in the market. You understand that your public address on the relevant Blockchain Network will be made publicly visible whenever you engage in a transaction on the App. You understand that accept that the App is highly experimental in nature, so certain features may not be fully available or may be varied or withdrawn from time to time without notice.
        </p>
        
        <p className="mb-4">
          Potential digital asset transactions offered by third party protocols (including Liquidity Pools) may be visualised on a user interface that the user can interact with, including but not limited to the website at https://aura.money/ and each of their subdomains, or our mobile or web applications (the "<strong className="text-[#2c3e50]">Site</strong>").
        </p>
        
        <p className="mb-4">
          The Company's sole role is the deployment of the user interface on the App, and accordingly any interaction with Smart Contracts or Liquidity Pools take place solely on the relevant Blockchain Network, and is managed and controlled by the relevant third party team of the relevant third party protocol which is unconnected. All interactions take place in a non-custodial manner and it is important that you understand that the Company solely functions as a provider of technical tools for users hence there is no control by or interaction by the Company in respect of your transactions or any of your digital assets. The Company is not offering any sort of securities product or regulated service nor does it hold any user assets on custody. Any digital assets to be earned by user interactions arise solely out of their involvement in the protocol by taking on the risk of interacting with other users and the ecosystem.

You acknowledge and agree that you are aware of such risks, including the following: (a) transactions relating to digital assets are very risky, and such digital assets are, by their nature, highly experimental, risky, volatile and generally irreversible. You should not make any transactional decision without first conducting your own research. You are solely and exclusively responsible for determining whether any digital asset transaction, Smart Contract, Liquidity Pools, any transaction, or strategy, or any other product or service in connection with the same is appropriate or suitable for you based on your own objectives and personal and financial situation.

You accept all consequences of participating in such interactions, including the risk that you may lose access to your digital assets indefinitely. All decisions to interact with the App are made solely by you. Notwithstanding anything in these Terms, the Company accepts no responsibility whatsoever for and will in no circumstances be liable to you in connection with any interaction with the App and any underlying digital assets. Under no circumstances will the operation of all or any portion of the Site or the App be deemed to create a relationship that includes any management of any assets, or the provision or tendering of investment advice.</span>

            <span>The prices of blockchain assets are extremely volatile. Fluctuations in the price of other digital assets could materially and adversely affect the value of your digital assets interacting with the App, which may also be subject to significant price volatility. We cannot guarantee that any users interacting with the App will not lose money.</span>

            <span>The App does not hold in custody, store, send, or receive any of your digital assets.

Interaction with the App or any Smart Contracts are entirely at your own responsibility and liability. In particular, when you trade with integrated third party protocols, the development team for these third party protocols is independent from the Company, so the Company has no control over these third party protocols or the underlying Smart Contracts. All Smart Contracts may contain security vulnerabilities, errors, failures, bugs or economic loopholes which may be exploited by third parties, causing you to suffer losses in connection with any digital assets interacting with the same. The Company cannot be responsibility for any security vulnerabilities, errors, failures, bugs or economic loopholes in respect of these third party protocols or the underlying Smart Contracts.</span>

            <span>Aura is not able to guarantee the future performance of digital assets interacting with the App, any vault or any Liquidity Pool, or any specific level of performance. When reviewing the information, portfolio, performance, opinions of third party protocols, do not assume that such information is unbiased, independent or reliable. Past performance and risk scores have many inherent limitations and are not indicative of future results. No representation or guarantee is being made that any user of Aura will or is likely to achieve gains or losses similar to the past performance.

            <span>Hackers or other malicious groups or organisations may attempt to interfere with the App or Smart Contracts in a variety of ways, including, but not limited to, malware attacks, denial of service attacks, consensus-based attacks, Sybil attacks, smurfing and spoofing. Furthermore, because the relevant Blockchain Network comprises open-source software, there is the software underlying the services may contain intentional or unintentional bugs or weaknesses that may negatively affect the App services or the Smart Contracts, or result in the loss of the user's original digital assets or bridged/wrapped assets, or the loss of the user's ability to access or control their digital assets. In the event of such a software bug or weakness, there may be no remedy, and users are not guaranteed any remedy, refund or compensation.</span>

            <span>The regulatory status of original digital assets and bridged/wrapped assets, and distributed ledger technology is unclear or unsettled in many jurisdictions. It is difficult to predict how or whether regulatory agencies may apply existing regulation with respect to the App Services. It is likewise difficult to predict how or whether legislatures or regulatory agencies may implement changes to law and regulation affecting distributed ledger technology and its applications, including the Services. Regulatory actions could negatively impact Aura in various ways, and thus the Services may not be available in certain areas.</span>
